Project Overview: Google Account Management 
A streamlined redesign of the Google Account interface, focusing on data transparency and urgent task management.

1. Problem & Research
The Issue: Privacy settings are usually buried, and critical emails (like visa expiries) get lost in a cluttered inbox.

The Goal: Make data usage visible and prioritize "high-consequence" emails.

2. The Process
Flows: Built a 3-tab system: Home (Profile), My Digital Self (Privacy), and Critical Gmails (Action).

Iterations: Started with basic lists; evolved into using color-coded bars for data tracking and interactive chips for interest management.

3. Key Features (Final Screens)
Data Usage Visualizer: A multi-color bar showing exactly which services use your data.

Interest Management: "Chips" that show what Google thinks you like, with one-click removal.

Urgency Analysis: A Gmail view that highlights the real-life consequence of missing an email deadline.

Digital Legacy: A simple setup for what happens to your data if your account becomes inactive.

4. Impact & Learning
Learning: Mastered layout management using Tailwind CSS and state-switching with Vanilla JS.

Impact: Demonstrated that complex privacy data can be made user-friendly through clean, visual design.
